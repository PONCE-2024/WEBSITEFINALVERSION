                <h1>HI THERE!</h1>
                <h5><span>WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ME?</span> I GOT YOU!</h5>
                <p>My name is Daniel L. Ponce an 18 yrs old IT student in Quezon City University. For me i think my personality is just bland you know just a typical teen
                that likes video games and hyper and talkative when friends are around. My hobbies are playing basketball and cycling because it makes my body active and more productive.
                I like music, specially to the songs that i liked, when i want to relax or focus music is there to cope me up. I like sight seeing too, because it feels so magical and peaceful to see
                some views that are beautiful it feels like a masterpiece like nature, beautiful clouds and places you've never been before. I have 2 goals and a dream, My first goal is a short term goal and
                it is to graduate from college. I want to to pay off my parents' hardwork and their sacrifice for my education by offering them the diploma i will get. My second goal is a long term goal and 
                it is to be rich and successful. i know it will be long but i will make it short as much as i can. The last one, my dream and this is a dream of my past me and present me. I can't say it now 
                but i hope my future me will be the one that will tell to you what it is.
